learning github

Hi.  I'm used to proprietary SCCM systems where you request a checkout and then do a checkin.  Systems like:  Serena ChangeMan, Serena Dimensions, CA Endevor, CA Harvest, IBM ClearCase, IBM Rational Team Concert.  

With GitHub its nice to be able to access your code wherever you are publically or privately.
And it seems convenient to have repos for every project
